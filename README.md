-------------

Welcome to Minesweeper! This is a command line version of the popular game. To play, just run the minesweeper.rb file in the command line and follow the instructions.

### How to Play

+ Run minesweeper.rb in the command line (ie, `ruby minesweeper.rb`)
+ If there is a saved game, you will be asked if you would like to load it. Enter 'y' if you would like to continue a saved game. Enter 'n' otherwise.
+ Choose your difficulty:
  + 'b' for beginner. This equates to a 9x9 board with 10 bombs
  + 'i' for intermediate. This equates to a 16x16 board with 40 bombs
  + 'e' for expert. This equates to a 30x16 board with 99 bombs
+ For each input, enter an option and then the position (eg: 'r 1 1')
  + 'r': reveal; reveals a space (same as left clicking a space)
  + 'f': flag; flag a space (same as right clicking a space)
+ If you would like to save and exit a game, just enter 'save' instead of an option. You can enter a position but it will not be saved.
+ Enjoy!
